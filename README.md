Simle weather app to help users determine when conditions will be good for rock climbing or other outdoor stuff. I made this because it was difficult to find a nice way to get both past and forecast weather data from one input. Powered by Node.js, Express.js, and the following libraries and APIs:
- [sunCalc](https://github.com/mourner/suncalc) for sunrise and sunset azimuth and time
- [tzLookup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tz-lookup) for getting timezone local to the inputted location
- [locationIQ API](https://my.locationiq.com/) for geocoding and map image
- [openWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) for reverse geocoding to get location autocomplete
- [Open-Meto API](https://github.com/open-meteo/open-meteo) for weather data
